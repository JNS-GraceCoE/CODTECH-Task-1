# Overview of the Project
## Project:EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on Employee Data dataset
## Objective
1. To perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. 
2. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
3. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.
## Key Activities
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter notebook
- Power BI
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
- .csv file
## Key Insights and Interpretation
-Check for correlations:
Use the heatmap to identify any strong correlations between variables like Experience and Salary.

-Identify any patterns or trends:
Look at the scatter plots and box plots to see if certain positions or genders have significantly different salaries.

-Detect and handle outliers:
Use the box plots to detect any outliers in Salary or Experience. You may consider treating these outliers depending on the context.

## Conclusion
- Based on this EDA, you can summarize your findings. For example, you might notice that certain positions have higher salaries, or there is a strong positive correlation between Experience and Salary.
- This analysis helps you understand the dataset and guides further analysis or modeling tasks.
